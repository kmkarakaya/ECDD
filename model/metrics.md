# Model Metrics (POC)

This file will collect model artifact sizes and inference timings performed during WP-002.

Example entries:

- `model/dummy` (POC JS runtime): size N/A, inference time ~50-200ms (varies by input size)
- `model/model_tfjs/` : size: TBD
- `model/model_onnx/` : size: TBD

Record measurements below after running POC.
